## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- 4 phases derived from 5 requirement categories, combining NOTF + AGNT into a single phase
- [Roadmap]: Phase ordering follows "observe, optimize, visualize" per research recommendation
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Notifications & Agent Capabilities) depends only on Phase 1, allowing potential parallel execution with Phases 2-3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research Pitfall 1]: cost_events table lacks cachedInputTokens column -- must fix in Phase 1 before optimization work
- [Research Pitfall 3]: heartbeat.ts is a 2,400-line monolith with no unit tests -- sub-module extraction needed in Phase 1
- [Research Pitfall 2]: Claude auto-compaction silently degrades agent behavior -- needs monitoring/mitigation in Phase 2
